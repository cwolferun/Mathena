# Mathena
a calculator where functions are integrated or computed on a server machine and sent back to the client 

Mathena is a client to server cloud computing app. It runs a an android client machine to send a function and its data points to 
server where it is evaluted using numerical methods that may be resource heavy and could be executed faster on a host machine.
Only the resolved answer is returned back to the client. 
All but the directory named "html" belong to the front end application. 
The scope of the project is to handle derivatives, integral, double integral, and small systems of linear equations.
